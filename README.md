When it comes to your heart, early and accurate diagnosis is key to preventing serious problems and staying healthy. One of the most effective ways to detect heart issues is with a Cardiac CT (Computed Tomography) scan. This non-invasive imaging test provides clear and detailed images of your heart and surrounding arteries, helping doctors identify signs of heart disease early, often before symptoms even appear.
At Butler Medical Imaging, we offer advanced CT cardiac scans in Butler to help our patients and their doctors better understand and manage heart health with confidence.
What is a Cardiac CT Scan?
A Cardiac CT scan is a painless, non-surgical test that uses X-rays to create highly detailed images of your heart and blood vessels. The machine takes multiple X-ray pictures from different angles, and a computer combines them into a cross-sectional image of the heart. This allows doctors to examine your heart’s anatomy in great detail.
CT scans are widely used to evaluate health conditions in many parts of the body, including bones, tissue, and organs. But when focused on the heart, they provide crucial information that can help diagnose heart disease and plan treatment.
Depending on your specific condition, the scan can be performed with or without contrast dye. The dye, which is injected through a vein, helps highlight the blood vessels and gives an even clearer picture of the heart’s function and structure.
Types of Cardiac CT Scans
There are a few different types of CT cardiac scans, and the one your doctor recommends will depend on your symptoms, risk factors, and medical history. The most common types include:
1. Calcium Score Screening
This scan looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries—the vessels that supply blood to your heart. A buildup of calcium is an early sign of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. This test is quick and doesn’t require contrast dye. It’s often used as a screening tool for people at risk of heart disease, even if they don’t have symptoms yet.
A higher calcium score means there is a greater risk of heart problems like a heart attack in the future. Identifying this early allows you and your doctor to take steps to improve your heart health with lifestyle changes or medication.
2. Coronary CT Angiogram (CTA)
This is a more detailed scan that provides a 3D image of your heart and the arteries that bring blood to it. It is commonly used to detect blockages or narrowing in the coronary arteries, which can cause chest pain or increase the risk of a heart attack.
A CTA is less invasive than a traditional angiogram, which requires a catheter to be inserted into the body. With a CTA, the same results can be achieved without any tubes or surgical procedures. A contrast dye is typically used in this test to highlight the blood vessels for clearer images.
Why a Cardiac CT Scan May Be Needed
Your doctor may recommend a CT cardiac scan if you have:
•	Chest pain or tightness
•	Shortness of breath
•	A family history of heart disease
•	High blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol
•	Abnormal ECG results
•	Risk factors for atherosclerosis
•	Unexplained fatigue or dizziness
These scans are often used as part of routine heart health check-ups, especially in people over 40 or those with risk factors for heart disease.
